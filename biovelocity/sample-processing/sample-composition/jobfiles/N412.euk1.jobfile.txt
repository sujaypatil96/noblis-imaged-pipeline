# Constants
# K-mer size. Min:1, Max:Length of your genome. Smaller k-mer is less sensitive to sequencing errors and
# coverage, while larger k-mers reduce ambiguous sequences. This value should be a multiple of 3 and sees
# diminishing returns the larger it is.Typically this value is never higher than 39. Also smaller genomes
# (bacterial and viral) use smaller k-mer size and vice versa.
KEY_LENGTH=15
# The number of k-mer keys to try during alignment. The program has been optimized around 3 and changing it is
# not recommended.
KEY_ITERATIONS=3
# The number of index entries for a certain k-mer before a bin stops being filled. This threshold prevents poly-A 
# repeats or similar from causing alignment to get bogged down when processing sequences with low complexity
MAX_BIN_SIZE=100000
# Threshold of ACTG mismatches in an alignment below which an alignment is ignored. 0-100. 95 is standard.
MAX_MISMATCH_PERC=95
# Threshold of N (ambiguous bases) mismatches in an alignment below which an alignment is ignored. 0-100. 95 is standard.
MAX_N_MISMATCH_PERC=95
# Threshold of contiuous ACTG mismatches above which an alignment is ignored. Takes integers. 3 is standard.
